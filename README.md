# Muley Tools

Beginning with a mocked application network, this organization is home to casual tools
that help a **MuleSoft Developer** get the job done.

At this point, the primary concern is to complete the RAMLs that make up the various
APIs in the network. 

Along the way however, it will be necessary to cobble up some
name generator code, and a city name generator along with a full address generator.
Mostly these tools will be needed in the CompositeDB API and in the "telegraph" module
