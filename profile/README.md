**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

The initial collection is designed to implement a bare bones Application Network, one that is suitable to frame
a converstion about the **Anypoint Platform Visualizer**

There are 9 APIs in total, four SAPIs, three PAPIs, and two XAPIs.

One of the APIs is intended to periodically introduce events into the network. Not big E events, but just the normal sort, such as a flight cancellation, or a status update.

One of the APIs simulates the presence of a database. It handles transactions related to the American Airlines flights API, the passengers data, and the reservations data. (Composite DB API)

At this time, it would be best to let the firmament settle a bit before we begin with the community evolution. I have some ideas for great evolutions of the model network, but I need some time to stablize the core. Hang on to those great ideas.
